# Setting up

Let's start by asking chatgpt for a gitignore for our react project.

### "can you output a .gitignore for react projects?"

Certainly! Below is a typical .gitignore file for a React project:

```
# Dependency directories
/node_modules

# Production build
/build

# Local development server files
/.env

# IDE files
/.idea
/.vscode

# macOS
.DS_Store

# Windows
Thumbs.db

# Logs
*.log

# Environment variables
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local

# Build artifacts
*.pem
*.der
*.key
*.csr
*.crt
*.cert
*.jks
You can add or modify entries according to your specific project needs.
```
